                <p><img src="https://placeimg.com/250/250/tech" style="padding: 0 2% 2% 0; float: left;">No children have ever meddled with the Republican Party and lived to tell about it. Old people don't need companionship. They need to be isolated and studied so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted for our personal use.</p>
                <p>Beer. Now there's a temporary solution. This is the greatest case of false advertising I've seen since I sued the movie "The Never Ending Story. <strong>" Please do not offer my god a peanut.</strong> <em> That's why I love elementary school, Edna.</em> The children believe anything you tell them.</p>
                <h2>How is education supposed to make me feel smarter? Besides, every time I learn something new, it pushes some old stuff out of my brain. Remember when I took that home winemaking course, and I forgot how to drive?</h2>
                <p>Kids, kids. I'm not going to die. That only happens to bad people. Here's to alcohol, the cause of — and solution to — all life's problems. I've done everything the Bible says — even the stuff that contradicts the other stuff!</p>
                <ol style="color: chartreuse">
                    <li>Attempted murder? Now honestly, what is that? Do they give a Nobel Prize for attempted chemistry?</li>
                    <li>When I held that gun in my hand, I felt a surge of power…like God must feel when he's holding a gun.</li>
                    <li>Marge, you being a cop makes you the man! Which makes me the woman — and I have no interest in that, besides occasionally wearing the underwear, which as we discussed, is strictly a comfort thing.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>I didn't think it was physically possible, but this both sucks *and* blows.</h2>
                <p>Books are useless! I only ever read one book, "To Kill A Mockingbird," and it gave me absolutely no insight on how to kill mockingbirds! Sure it taught me not to judge a man by the color of his skin…but what good does *that* do me? Oh, everything looks bad if you remember it.</p>
                <ul style="color: chartreuse;">
                    <li>Fat Tony is a cancer on this fair city! He is the cancer and I am the…uh…what cures cancer?</li>
                    <li>Son, when you participate in sporting events, it's not whether you win or lose: it's how drunk you get.</li>
                    <li>Beer. Now there's a temporary solution.</li>

                <p><img src="https://placeimg.com/250/250/tech" style="padding: 0 2% 2% 0; float: right;">D'oh. This is the greatest case of false advertising I've seen since I sued the movie "The Never Ending Story." How could you?! Haven't you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? Captain Whatshisname? We live in a society of laws! Why do you think I took you to all those Police Academy movies? For fun? Well, I didn't hear anybody laughing, did you? Except at that guy who made sound effects. Makes sound effects and laughs. Where was I? Oh yeah! Stay out of my booze.</p>
                <p>Yes! I am a citizen! Now which way to the welfare office? I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I work, I work. Uh, no, you got the wrong number. This is 9-1…2. I prefer a vehicle that doesn't hurt Mother Earth. It's a go-cart, powered by my own sense of self-satisfaction.</p>
                <p>Jesus must be spinning in his grave! I hope I didn't brain my damage. The Internet King? I wonder if he could provide faster nudity… A lifetime of working with nuclear power has left me with a healthy green glow…and left me as impotent as a Nevada boxing commissioner.</p>
                <p>But, Aquaman, you cannot marry a woman without gills. You're from two different worlds… Oh, I've wasted my life. Oh, loneliness and cheeseburgers are a dangerous mix. Son, when you participate in sporting events, it's not whether you win or lose: it's how drunk you get.</p>
                <p>Well, he's kind of had it in for me ever since I accidentally ran over his dog. Actually, replace "accidentally" with "repeatedly" and replace "dog" with "son." Get ready, skanks! It's time for the truth train!</p>
                <p>You know, the one with all the well meaning rules that don't work out in real life, uh, Christianity. Marge, just about everything's a sin. Y'ever sat down and read this thing? Technically we're not supposed to go to the bathroom.</p>
                <p>What's the point of going out? We're just going to wind up back here anyway. Please do not offer my god a peanut. Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try. Get ready, skanks! It's time for the truth train!</p>
                <p>Stan Lee never left. I'm afraid his mind is no longer in mint condition. Son, when you participate in sporting events, it's not whether you win or lose: it's how drunk you get. Thank you, steal again. How could you?! Haven't you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? Captain Whatshisname? We live in a society of laws! Why do you think I took you to all those Police Academy movies? For fun? Well, I didn't hear anybody laughing, did you? Except at that guy who made sound effects. Makes sound effects and laughs. Where was I? Oh yeah! Stay out of my booze.</p>
                <p>Whoa, slow down there, maestro. There's a *New* Mexico? Remember the time he ate my goldfish? And you lied and said I never had goldfish. Then why did I have the bowl, Bart? *Why did I have the bowl?* Facts are meaningless. You could use facts to prove anything that's even remotely true!</p>
                <p>I was saying "Boo-urns." Books are useless! I only ever read one book, "To Kill A Mockingbird," and it gave me absolutely no insight on how to kill mockingbirds! Sure it taught me not to judge a man by the color of his skin…but what good does *that* do me?</p>
                <p>What's the point of going out? We're just going to wind up back here anyway. Can't you people take the law into your own hands? I mean, we can't be policing the entire city! He didn't give you gay, did he? Did he?!</p>
